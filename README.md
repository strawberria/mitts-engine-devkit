## Changelog
- **0.1.0 - Initial Release (nothing new)**
- **0.2.0 - Minimap support and additional interaction criteria/results**
    - Added in-game support for non-normal states including `transition`, `goodEnding`, and `badEnding` 
    - Added in-game support for minimap clicking which shows dialog and/or reveals object (executing custom interaction planned for the future, eventually.)
    - Added additional interaction criteria `targetTag_component1`  and `targetTag_component2` which check whether the given tag exists on target object or restraint (targeted restraint locations in this case are ignoredx`)
    - Added additional interaction results `restraintAddTarget` and `restraintRemoveTarget` which add or remove the targeted restraint if criteria are met (currently only target 1)
- **0.3.0 - Maximum attempts implementation and automatic transpiling from older versions**
    - Added 'maximum attempts' feature per-state which automatically transitions states when maximum attempts is reached, which is useful for implementing time-based bad ends (and also optimization-heavy puzzles eventually?)
    - Added automatic transpilation from older versions (currently 0.1.0/0.2.0 to 0.3.0) which adds/modifies/removes the necessary data from the project before updating the officially supported engine version
    - Fixed bug causing interactions filter to not work properly
- **0.3.1 - Added backup location to `locationRemove` interaction result for seamless 'replacement' of minimap locations**
    - Make sure to `locationAdd` the new location before `locationRemove` the old location, setting the "Backup Location" to the newly added location - this results in a seamless 'update' of the minimap.
- **0.3.2 - Fixed issues with `locationRemove` interaction result**
    - Fixed currently selected minimap location not being preserved if other is removed
    - Fixed location ID not resetting properly on location being removed if it's the first 
    - Also added backup functionality when "Backup Location" is selected - if backup location is currently not accessible by the player, it's added (works identically to `locationAdd`)
